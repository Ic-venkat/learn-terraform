Previously we discussed how we can provision resouces using terraform and in this section we will learn how we can update and destroy resources we provisioned using terraform.

This is the code we used in previous section.
```tf
resource "local_file" "getting-started" {
    filename = "./getting-started.txt"
    content = "Getting started with terraform" 
}
```
**Update:**
Now we ill change the above code to this

```tf
resource "local_file" "getting-started" {
    filename = "./getting-start.txt"
    content = "Getting started with terraform" 
}
```

So instead of `./getting-started.txt` now we have `./getting-start.txt`. Now again we run `terraform plan` command to see what steps it is going to take to make this change.

Now you can use `terraform apply` command to execute the changes. This is going to delete existing file and them create the new file back again with new name.

**Destroy:**
To delete the infrastructure completely you can run the `terraform destroy` command.



**Note:** If you have added an additional provider after `terraform init` you need to rerun this command again to initialize new providers which were added.
