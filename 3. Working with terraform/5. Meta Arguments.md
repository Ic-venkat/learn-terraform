What if you want to create multiple instances of the same resource? In programming, we use loops, but how can we achieve this in Terraform?

Terraform allows for the use of meta-arguments within resource blocks to modify the behavior of resources. We have previously encountered two meta-arguments: `depends_on` and `lifecycle`. Now, let's explore additional meta-arguments, specifically those related to loops.

### Count Meta-Argument

The `count` meta-argument can be used to create multiple instances of a resource. For example, to create three local files, you can use the following configuration:

```tf
resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename = var.filename
    count    = 3
}

variable "filename" {
    default = [
        "root/pet.txt"
    ]
}
```

In this code, three local files are created. The resource is treated as a list of resources rather than a single resource. You can access them as `pet[0]`, `pet[1]`, and `pet[2]`.

**Note:** This configuration will create the same file three times, which can be problematic.

A better approach is to provide a list of filenames and use the `count.index` to ensure each file is unique. Consider the following example:

```tf
resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename = var.filename[count.index]
    count    = 3
}

variable "filename" {
    default = [
        "root/pet2.txt",
        "root/dogs.txt",
        "root/cats.txt"
    ]
}
```

In this revised example, three different files (`pet2.txt`, `dogs.txt`, and `cats.txt`) are created, resolving the issue of creating identical files multiple times.
