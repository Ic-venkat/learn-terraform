You can specify a specific version of a provider in your infrastructure configuration. Providers frequently update, so it's advisable to lock into a version to avoid unexpected errors with new releases in Terraform.

Here's an example of locking the version of the `local` provider:

```tf
terraform {
    required_providers {
        local = {
            source  = "hashicorp/local"
            version = "1.4.0"
        }
    }
} 
```

In this configuration, we ensure that our infrastructure uses version `1.4.0` of the `local` provider, providing stability and predictability in our Terraform deployments.
