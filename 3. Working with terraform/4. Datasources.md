Data sources in Terraform refer to resources that are not directly managed by Terraform but can still be utilized within your infrastructure. This feature is particularly useful when you need to reference resources created by another infrastructure or managed outside of your Terraform configuration. Here are a couple of examples to illustrate this concept:

In the first example, we reference a local file:

```tf
data "local_file" "test" {
    filename = "./test.txt"
}
```

In the second example, we reference an existing S3 bucket:

```tf
data "aws_s3_bucket" "selected" {
  bucket = "bucket.test.com"
}
```

consider this example using localfile content as dependency for another resouce

```tf
resource "local_file" "temp" {
    filename = "./temp"
    content = data.local_file.test.content
}
```

These data sources allow you to integrate and utilize resources that are not directly under Terraform's control, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of your infrastructure management.
