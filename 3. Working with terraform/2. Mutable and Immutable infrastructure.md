In Terraform, when we make changes to resources, it will often destroy the existing resource and then recreate it with the updated configuration. In some cases we don't want this to happen and this can be fixed using life cycle rules in terrform because in some cases we don't want resources to be deleted before our new resource is provisioned.

### Mutable Infrastructure

With traditional server management, we update the software on servers to newer versions. For instance, if we have an Nginx server running version 1.17 and want to upgrade it to version 1.18, we would update the Nginx software on the existing server. However, this process can sometimes fail due to configuration mismatches. In environments with hundreds of servers, some may successfully upgrade while others do not, leading to a situation known as `configuration drift`.

### Immutable Infrastructure

In contrast, immutable infrastructure involves creating new servers with the desired software versions rather than upgrading existing ones. For example, instead of updating an old server running Nginx 1.17 to 1.18, we would deploy new servers with Nginx 1.18 and replace the old servers with the new ones. This approach ensures consistency and eliminates configuration drift.
