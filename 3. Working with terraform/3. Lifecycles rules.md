In the previous section, we discussed the differences between mutable and immutable infrastructure. Now, we will establish some lifecycle rules to manage resource changes more effectively. Instead of destroying and then creating resources when changes occur, we can use the `create_before_destroy` strategy. Consider the following example:

Here is our initial resource definition:
```tf
resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename = "/root/pets.txt"
    content = "I like pets"
}
```

In this case, the resource uses default file permissions. In the updated example, we specify different file permissions and implement a lifecycle rule to create the new resource before destroying the old one. This ensures the new resource is ready before the old resource is removed:

```tf
resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename = "/root/pets.txt"
    content = "I like pets"
    file_permission = "0700"

    lifecycle {
        create_before_destroy = true
    }
}
```

By using `create_before_destroy`, we can ensure a smooth transition when updating resources, avoiding potential downtime or resource unavailability.


There is another argument like `prevent_destroy` which can be used to prevent accidental deletion of resources.


There is this terraform `ignore changes` argument which can be used to ignore any changes to some particular resouce arguments mentioned in the life cycle rules.
