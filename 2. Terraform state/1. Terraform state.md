### Understanding Terraform State

By now, we have covered writing simple configuration files, provisioning resources, declaring variables, and connecting resources using dependencies.

When you run the `terraform apply` command, Terraform provisions the resources and creates an additional file called `terraform.tfstate`. This file contains information about the current state of your infrastructure.

#### Key Points:

1. **State File (`terraform.tfstate`):**
   - The state file is a JSON data structure that maps real-world resources to the resources defined in your configuration files.
   
2. **Purpose of the State File:**
   - Terraform uses the state file to keep track of the resources it manages.
   - If changes are made to the configuration files, Terraform compares the current state (as described in `terraform.tfstate`) with the desired state (as described in your configuration files).
   - Any discrepancies between the current and desired state are identified, and Terraform makes the necessary updates to align the actual infrastructure with the configuration.

By maintaining this state file, Terraform ensures that it can accurately manage and update your infrastructure, providing a clear and consistent approach to infrastructure as code.
